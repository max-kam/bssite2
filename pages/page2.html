        What is Push? In Push systems, the Producer determines when to send data to the Consumer. The Consumer is unaware of when it will receive that data.

Promises are the most common type of Push system in JavaScript today. A Promise (the Producer) delivers a resolved value to registered callbacks (the Consumers), but unlike functions, it is the Promise which is in charge of determining precisely when that value is "pushed" to the callbacks.

RxJS introduces Observables, a new Push system for JavaScript. An Observable is a Producer of multiple values, "pushing" them to Observers (Consumers).

A Function is a lazily evaluated computation that synchronously returns a single value on invocation.
A generator is a lazily evaluated computation that synchronously returns zero to (potentially) infinite values on iteration.
A Promise is a computation that may (or may not) eventually return a single value.
An Observable is a lazily evaluated computation that can synchronously or asynchronously return zero to (potentially) infinite values from the time it's invoked onwards.
For more info about what to use when converting Observables to Promises, please refer to this guide.

Observables as generalizations of functions
Contrary to popular claims, Observables are not like EventEmitters nor are they like Promises for multiple values. Observables may act like EventEmitters in some cases, namely when they are multicasted using RxJS Subjects, but usually they don't act like EventEmitters.

Observables are like functions with zero arguments, but generalize those to allow multiple values.
